### [The C10K problem](http://http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html)

It's time for web servers to handle ten thousand clients simultaneously, don't you think? After all, the web is a big place now.

随着web世界的发展壮大，web服务器已经需要支持1万并发了。

And computers are big, too. You can buy a 1000MHz machine with 2 gigabytes of RAM and an 1000Mbit/sec Ethernet card for $1200 or so. Let's see - at 20000 clients, that's 50KHz, 100Kbytes, and 50Kbits/sec per client. It shouldn't take any more horsepower than that to take four kilobytes from the disk and send them to the network once a second for each of twenty thousand clients. (That works out to $0.08 per client, by the way. Those $100/client licensing fees some operating systems charge are starting to look a little heavy!) So hardware is no longer the bottleneck.

同时，主机也在发展，你可以花差不多1200刀买到1000MHz cpu，2G内存，千兆网卡配置的主机。粗略计算一下，2万个客户，大概每个用户每秒分到50KHz，100K内存，50K的网络流量。这样的配置可以轻松驾驭2w的客户的网络IO，大概每秒4Kb的读取以及网络发送。（换算一下成本，大概每个用户0.08刀，跟这个成本相比，有些操作系统每100用户100刀的授权费用看起来就有一点贵了！）
所以硬件当前已经不是瓶颈了。

In 1999 one of the busiest ftp sites, cdrom.com, actually handled 10000 clients simultaneously through a Gigabit Ethernet pipe. As of 2001, that same speed is now being offered by several ISPs, who expect it to become increasingly popular with large business customers.

1999年度最火的ftp站之一，cdrom.com,其实已经通过千兆网卡在支撑1万用户的并发了,到了2001年，部分ISP们已经可以提供千兆网卡的速度，他们觉得对于大型的商业用户，这种需求可能会越来越旺盛。

And the thin client model of computing appears to be coming back in style -- this time with the server out on the Internet, serving thousands of clients.

随着可以高可用高并发的因特网服务器出现，新的瘦客户端计算模型也进入了大众视野。

With that in mind, here are a few notes on how to configure operating systems and write code to support thousands of clients. The discussion centers around Unix-like operating systems, as that's my personal area of interest, but Windows is also covered a bit.

基于这种情况，这里总结了一些操作系统配置方法和编码经验，来支持高并发。当然主要是基于类Unix系统，毕竟这块是我的专业，当然也可能是涉及一点windows平台的知识。

See Nick Black's execellent [Fast UNIX Servers](http://dank.qemfd.net/dankwiki/index.php/Network_servers) page for a circa-2009 look at the situation.
In October 2003, Felix von Leitner put together an excellent [web page](http://bulk.fefe.de/scalability/) and [presentation](http://bulk.fefe.de/scalable-networking.pdf) about network scalability, complete with benchmarks comparing various networking system calls and operating systems. One of his observations is that the 2.6 Linux kernel really does beat the 2.4 kernel, but there are many, many good graphs that will give the OS developers food for thought for some time. (See also the [Slashdot](http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/10/19/0130256.shtml?tid=106&tid=130&tid=185&tid=190) comments; it'll be interesting to see whether anyone does followup benchmarks improving on Felix's results.)

2003年10月份，Felix做了一份网络可扩展性的研究，针对多种操作系统的系统调用做了性能对比。其中一项观察为，Linux 2.6的内核确实比2.4的内核性能优秀；还有其他成果，给操作系统开发人员非常多的优化思路。（可以看看Slashdot这里的评论，能看到读者反馈，使用了Felix的建议，提升了性能)
